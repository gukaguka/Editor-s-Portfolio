                <h3>"A Birth Of Georgia" - Director, Videographer, Editor, Colorist</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a highly acclaimed documentary-style series for social media and TV aimed at shining light upon the recent history of Georgia and the collapse of the Soviet Union and Georgia's independence. The series covers interviews with people involved in historical events that shaped our reality and who are still alive today. We collect and preserve stories from different points of view, even conflicting sides, to provide future generations with insights about monumental periods for our country. The series started as a YouTube project but quickly gained great success, turned into a TV series, and collected TV awards along the way.

                <h3>"Educational Animated Series" - Director, Post-Production, Production</h3>
                <p>
                    This was an educational animated series that was part of an unusual and somewhat original political campaign conducted for Parliamentary Elections in Georgia by the only Libertarian party. The series aimed to raise awareness on different topics regarding economics, the free-market economy, juridical issues, education, social issues, bureaucracy, and more. My role was to direct the production and post-production to express and communicate complex ideas through structured narration, animation, and music.
