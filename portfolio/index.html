			<p>Hi! my name is Guram Gogichaishvili, 28, I am a professional Editor and Colorist (I do Audio Mastering/Sound Editing too), <br>
            I studied film making in Shota Rustaveli Theatre and Film Georgia State University,<br> My main editing tools are <strong> Davinci Resolve and Premier Pro.</strong> 
            <br> I've Directed, Edited And Color-graded two major social media(and later Television) projects, did short films, vlogs, social media promotion reels, etc. <br>
            When working with clients, I always try do deeply and meaningfully engage with the project and material that I am working on in order to bring the visions of the client/author to life, when client's happy I'm happy. I believe that no matter how small or big is the project,
            there is always a story to convey and style to develop via color or editing.
